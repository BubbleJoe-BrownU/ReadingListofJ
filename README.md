## Alfred | A system for prompted weak supervision

### Summary
Alfred is the first second-generation of Programmatic Weak Supervision (WPS) system that generates traininig data by prompting large language models (e.g., GPT, T5, T0++) or vision-language models (e.g. CLIP). Alfred adopts a dynamic batching strategy that groups inputs with similar sequence length together to minimize padding and therefore increase memory utilization and increase throughput.
